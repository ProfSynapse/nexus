# `src/services/llm/adapters/anthropic`

## Purpose
LLM adapter for provider "anthropic" (requests, streaming, tool-calls).

## What's Here
- Subfolders: _None_
- Files: `AnthropicAdapter.ts`, `AnthropicModels.ts`

## Improvement Ideas
- Consolidate shared HTTP/streaming/error-mapping logic across adapters.
- See `CODEBASE_AUDIT.md` (repo root) for cross-cutting cleanup opportunities.
