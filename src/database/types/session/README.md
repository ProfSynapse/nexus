# `src/database/types/session`

## Purpose
Types for database entities and storage/cache layers.

## What's Here
- Subfolders: _None_
- Files: `SessionTypes.ts`

## Improvement Ideas
- Consider consolidating/re-exporting types to reduce cross-folder imports.
- See `CODEBASE_AUDIT.md` (repo root) for cross-cutting cleanup opportunities.
